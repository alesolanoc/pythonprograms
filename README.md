# Artificial Intelligence By Example
This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788990547), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Artificial Intelligence by Example is your starting point to understanding how AI is built with the help of intriguing examples. Your will focus on how to become an adaptive thinker and understand the relationship between the concepts explained in the book and real-life situations. Using some of the best AI examples right from a simple chess engine to a cognitive chatbot, you will learn how to tackle a machine you are competing with. You will learn about advanced machine learning models, how to apply AI to blockchain and IoT, and develop the emotional quotient in chatbots using neural networks. You will focus more on how you can design the AI solution easily rather than complex machine learning and deep learning techniques. Artificial Intelligence by Example will be a starter kit for you to develop AI applications on your own.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters contain code files and data files as required.
**The VM image with setup batch files for Ubuntu can be downloaded from Packt website. (https://www.packtpub.com//books/content/support/33640)**

The code will look like the following:
```
MS1='full'
MS2='space'
I=['1','2','3','4','5','6']
for im in range(2):
```

Artificial Intelligence has the potential to replicate humans in every field. This book serves as a starting point for you to understand how AI is built, with the help of intriguing examples and case studies.

Artificial Intelligence By Example will make you an adaptive thinker and help you apply concepts to real-life scenarios. Using some of the most interesting AI examples, right from a simple chess engine to a cognitive chatbot, you will learn how to tackle the machine you are competing with. You will study some of the most advanced machine learning models, understand how to apply AI to blockchain and IoT, and develop emotional quotient in chatbots using neural networks.

You will move on to designing AI solutions in a simple manner rather than get confused by complex architectures and techniques. This comprehensive guide will be a starter kit for you to develop AI applications on your own.

By the end of this book, will have understood the fundamentals of AI and worked through a number of case studies that will help you develop business vision.
